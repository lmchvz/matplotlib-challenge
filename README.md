## Matplotlib Challenge - The Power of Plots; Pymaceuticals


### Project Description: 
The data includes four potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. 

The goal of this project is to analyze the Pymaceuticals' data and to use Matplotlib to show how the four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare. 

### Tools Used: 
- Python
- Pandas Library
- Matplotlib Library
